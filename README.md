I was preparing for a course on [VR at the University of Arts](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/animation-interactive-film-and-sound/undergraduate/ba-hons-virtual-reality-lcc) in London when I decided to sharpen up my tech skills and fell in love with programming. I realized this was my passion and undertook a 16-week intensive software development Bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/). I am now looking for a position where I can deepen my programming experience and make a meaningful contribution.

**Tech Skills**: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React, Python.

<h2 align="center" >Skills</h2>

### Leadership

When I started my company, I had to bring older, more experienced and knowledgeable people on board to invest money, time and energy into the business. This required vision, initiative and confidence. 
Running the company, there was no one to tell me what to do, so I had to be self-directed and self-organized. I wanted to further develop these skills, so I have since undertaken further training in Leadership skills at [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org).

### Public speaking

I have trained in Public Speaking at [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org), won 3 public speaking competitions at my local club, spoken at over 10 London venues, got 2nd place in a Poetry Slam, have been paid to speak as a Spoken Word Artist, spoken on the radio and a podcast and made two [Motivational speeches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2q87Ecq90I) at my local college.

### Fast learning and Problem Solving

I passed the Mensa test which puts me in the top 2% of problem solvers. I demonstrated my capacity to learn at exceptional speed and depth when I completed my A levels in 9 months (they normally take two years). Despite competing against people who had an extra year, I came out top of my college.

### Emotional Intelligence

As a monk, I was trained in meditation, self-reflection and awareness. My colleagues at Makers Academy have praised my ability to reflect, communicate my own emotions, seek out negative feedback and adapt accordingly, with enthusiasm and willingness to change. For example, I produced a piece of code for a group project. A member of the team pointed out some false assumptions I made. I defended the code, reflected, admitted I was attached to the code, consciously let go of the emotion and allowed the code to be replaced by a better solution.

### Automation

My business involved the exchange of GBP with cryptocurrency assets. This cost 1% per transaction using a third-party service, which was significant with a 5% margin for profit. I built from scratch a website, taught myself CSS, HTML, JavaScript, PHP, PostgreSQL and MongoDB to help automate this process. This increased profits per transaction by 25%.

### Teaching

While at Makers Academy I have had two Mentors, and took the time to teach them both individually how to set up their development environment, the principles and process of TDD and OOP, and helped them build a basic project. At my local college, I taught Math, Chemistry, Physics and meditation to the students, and I have also taught meditation to children with special needs, helping to bring more peace and joy into their lives.

### Motivate, Inspire and Raise the Team Spirit

In a project at Makers Academy, we hit a low after an arduous two day refactoring process. Spirits were drained and everyone looked like they were about to drop. I brought this up and encouraged everyone to rally themselves, pull together and enjoy the last few days of Makers. I raised a cheer from the team, renewed motivation and enthusiasm, and one team member even thanked me for helping to raise the spirits when she was in a funk. I have an indomitable spirit and unwavering optimism.

### Bonus

I can hack my own WiFi.
